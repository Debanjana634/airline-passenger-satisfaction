✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Machine Learning Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyses airline passenger satisfaction using Python and machine learning techniques.
The objective is to explore the dataset, identify key factors influencing satisfaction, and develop predictive models that classify passengers as Satisfied or Neutral/Unsatisfied.

🛠️ Steps Followed
1. Data Import & Inspection
Loaded dataset with Pandas

Checked shape, column names, missing values, and duplicates

2. Data Cleaning
Imputed missing values in Arrival Delay in Minutes using mean

Removed duplicate records

Ensured proper data types

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualised satisfaction distribution by travel type, age, and service ratings

Used Seaborn & Matplotlib for insights

4. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
Label encoded categorical variables

Standardised numerical features with StandardScaler

5. Model Development
Implemented and trained ML Models

6. Model Evaluation
Used accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

Compared model performance to select the most effective
